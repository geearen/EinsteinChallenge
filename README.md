Please create a parsing tool that takes the example config file (provided below) and turns it into a usable object in the language of your choice (hash, JSON object, associative array, class, etc). The instructions for this are below. Please let us know if you have any questions!

1. Do not use existing "complete" configuration parsing libraries/functions, we want to see how you would write the code to do this.

2. Use of core and stdlib functions/objects such as string manipulation, regular expressions, etc is ok.

3. We should be able to get the values of the config parameters in code, via their name. How this is done specifically is up to you.

4. Boolean-like config values (on/off, yes/no, true/false) should return real booleans: true/false.

5. Numeric config values should return real numerics: integers, doubles, etc

6. Ignore or error out on invalid config lines, your choice.

7. Please include a short example usage of your code so we can see how you call it/etc.

8. Push your work to a public git repository (github, bitbucket, etc) and send us the link.

### To run the parsing tool
In the terminal run
```
node parseTool.js
```
